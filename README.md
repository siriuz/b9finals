# RJChow's final assignment submission

Firstly I must apologise, most of the code is quite messy and not of the most legible formatting or naming!

I was unable to complete the full assignment, the test suite only contains the bare minimum instead of comprehensive coverage.

There is nothing special to the setup of the application, simply do `npm install` and things should work.

Tests are in the `test` folder, and the stipulated scenario tests are inside scenario_tests.js.
Tests are run using `truffle test test/`.

The frontend is mostly incomplete, I did not have time to get things done since TestRPC refused to play well with Metamask.
Frontend is served up using `npm run dev`.

Geth took too long and I simply did not have the time to finish it.

You can see that I do understand how to work the web3.js bits, as I have modified the Metacoin template enough to show understanding. In fact if you get it set up you should be able to set vehicle type.

Disclaimer: Frontend is totally my weakness so even if I had had time to finish it, it would be barebones.

# RJChow's final assignment submission

Firstly I must apologise, most of the code is quite messy and not of the most legible formatting or naming!

The test suite only contains the bare minimum instead of comprehensive coverage.

There is nothing special to the setup of the application, simply do `npm install` and things should work.

Tests are in the `test` folder, and the stipulated scenario tests are inside scenario_tests.js.
Tests are run using `truffle test test/`.
